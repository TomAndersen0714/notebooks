# MySQL SQL 基础教程



## Query


### Scalar Subquery

标量子查询

### DUAL

DUAL is purely for the convenience of people who require that all SELECT statements should have FROM and possibly other clauses. MySQL may ignore the clauses. MySQL does not require FROM DUAL if no tables are referenced.
```
SELECT 1+1 FROM DUAL
```


## Functions

### Window function
